# Classical-Mechanics-Simulator-in-2D

The aim of this project is to develop a system for simulating and visualizing classical mechanics phenomena in a two-dimensional space.
The application allows users to define initial conditions — such as force and velocity vectors acting on objects — and then observe the changes in their values and trajectories over time.


The system is designed to:

- enable interactive exploration of physical phenomena,
- provide clear and intuitive visualization of simulations,
- support easy extension with new models and experimental conditions.
